The goal of this project is to create a digital frame that
shows what's currently playing on Sonos. This GitHub repo
houses the software that powers the frame. The software is
written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js.

Status 2014-02-01: Most of the software is more or less
ready to go. I bought an [LCD display](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2109) from Adafruit, which
I'm going to try to hook up next.

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/monsur/sonos-now-playing/wiki/Software-Installation).
