sonos-now-playing
========================

The goal of this project is to create a digital frame that
shows what's currently playing on Sonos. This GitHub repo
houses the software that powers the frame. The software is
written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js.

Status 2014-02-16: The software is more or less ready to go.
I purchased an [10" HDMI 4 Pi display](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2109) from Adafruit, and the entire setup works (see pic below). Next step is to frame the display. I have a few ideas on how to do this, stay tuned!

Special thanks to [Rahim Sonawalla](http://www.hirahim.com/), whose [SoCo](http://python-soco.com/) library was the inspiration for all this.
