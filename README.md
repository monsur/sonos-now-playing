sonos-now-playing
========================

![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/monsur/sonos-now-playing-nodejs/master/screenshot.png)

The goal of this project is to create a digital frame that
shows what's currently playing on Sonos. This GitHub repo
houses the software that powers the frame. The software is
written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js.

Status 2014-02-01: The software is more or less ready to go.
I bought an [LCD display](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2109) from Adafruit,
which I'll to try to hook up next.

## Features
  * Shows the currently playing track on Sonos
  * Album art from the Last.FM API
  * Touch hotspots: touch the left-side to play/pause, touch the right-side to go to the next track
  * Screensaver: Screen goes blank after 15 minutes of no activity
